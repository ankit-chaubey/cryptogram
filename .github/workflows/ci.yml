          # cryptography is optional (used only by the pure-Python fallback).
          # On niche platforms (e.g. manylinux i686) there is no pre-built
          # wheel and building from source fails because cryptography's own
          # build deps (puccinialin) require Python >=3.9.  Use || true so
          # the C-extension primary backend can still be packaged and tested.

          # Install cryptography in the test venv too: if OpenSSL is
          # unavailable at runtime (e.g. unusual manylinux sandbox), the
          # C extension raises ImportError and __init__.py falls back to
          # _fallback.py — which needs cryptography to be importable.
